# liri-node-app

Create a node application that takes in arguments and does something with them.

Use the following API's

Spotify API (spotify-this-song)
OMDB API (movie-this)
Bands In Town API (concert-this)
Search the listed API's and return the data to the console.

Here is a video I recorded showing me using the app properly with no bugs.
